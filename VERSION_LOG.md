### To-Do List in order of importance

- [x] Figure out why MATLAB Runtime does not work on Apple Silicon.
- [x] Enhance optimizer prompting to behave similarly to the analyzer.
- [ ] Automatic montage visualization.
    1. create a subdirectory called: `Presentation_material` 
    2. have an image of the net with the montage marked with the channels
    3. name and title should correspond to montage+subject_name
- [ ] Develop a GUI solution for Apple Silicon.
- [ ] MATLAB .png output comes empty on macOS intel.
    1. error: MATLAB experienced a low level graphics error, and may not have drawn correctly.
    2. libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
- [ ] Improve placement for ROI & Montage JSONs.
- [ ] Add ROI analysis for patches of the cortex using different atlases.
- [ ] Add a tool to do EEG-Cap co-registration
    1. either with brainstorm function or with SimNIBS function
    2. Must have a GUI or some sort of automatic visual confirmation
- [ ] Add a prompt to ask what Net the user wants to use
- [ ] Add directionality measurement for Opt & Ana
- [ ] Multipolar Optimization
- [ ] Make optimizer ROI selecttion process similar to analyzer
    1. Have a roi-list.json file
    2. Create temp .csv files for the interpolator to work with and delete them at the end.
- [ ] Clean `main-mTI.sh` script. Unnecessary local variables. 
- [ ] Solve FSL GUI problem.
- [ ] Create an in-house FSL image based on Ubuntu 20.04.
- [ ] Create an in-house Freesurfer image, version 7.4.1.
- [ ] Eliminate NVIM popups.
- [ ] Create a GUI for the Application

## [Version 1.1.1] - 2024-08-29

### Added
- Automatic `T1_subjectID_MNI.nii.gz` creation for personalized visualization.
- Can now run multiple subjects in optimizer
- utils directory with `sphere-creater.py`

### Changed
- Subject prompting process in optimizer 
- User is not prompt to input project directory. Script does it automatically.

### Removed
- debugging output from `sphere-analysis.sh`

---

## [VERSION 1.1.0] - 2024-08-24

### Added
- MATLAB runtime now works on Apple silicon machines.

### Changed
- bash script to load image now changed from `start_TI_docker.sh` to `img-loader.sh`

#### Reference
- [WSL Issue #286 on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/286) - Follow the `metorm` comment.
- Recompile MATLAB as suggested by `Shubham` in MATLAB Central.
